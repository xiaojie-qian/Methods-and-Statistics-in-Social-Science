## Quizz
1. The ice cream shop has problems with the delivery of the different flavours. As a consequence the shop doesn't have the same amount of flavours every day. In the following list you see the probability distribution of the different amounts of flavours.
- Amount of flavours (*probability*)
- 4 (*0.14*)
- 5 (*0.35*)
- 6 (*0.31*)
- 7 (*0.20*)
What is the mean amount of flavours the ice cream shop sells? Give your answer in two decimals.
> *4*0.14 + 5*0.35 +6*0.31 + 7*0.20 = 0.56 + 1.75 + 1.86 + 1.4 = 5.57*

3. A researcher is interested in the time people spend online on social-media per day. She plots the probability distribution for this variable using hours as the unit, and it looks as follows:

What happens to the graph if she decides to measure the time in minutes instead of hours?
- The graph stays the same apart from the values on both axes.**
- The graph becomes flatter.
- The graph stays the same. Only the values on the x-axis change.
- **The graph becomes steeper.**

The equation above describes a normal distribution for a random variable *X*.

It appears that the time people in the age range of 20 to 50 years spend
 sleeping is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 7 hours 
and a standard deviation of 1 hour. Can you estimate the height of this 
probability density curve at the mean and also give the unit of this 
value?

Give your answer as a proportion, rounding to two decimal places.

>* 0.4: The value of the probability density equals the value of the constant in front of e.
Also note the unit of this value, which is 1/h (or 'probability per hour' if you prefer) - the unit of the standard deviation is the same as the random variable (hour).*

- *Neither of these is a proper cdf.*

- The dotted line represents a proper cdf, the dashed line doesn't.

- The dashed line represents a proper cdf, the dotted doesn't.

- Both lines can be proper cdfs.

>*The probability of the dashed line decreases from age 6 to 7, which is impossible for a cdf; and the dotted line increments to 0.9 while it should increment to 1.0 at an age of 10 years.*
