## Quizz
1. The ice cream shop has problems with the delivery of the different flavours. As a consequence the shop doesn't have the same amount of flavours every day. In the following list you see the probability distribution of the different amounts of flavours.
- Amount of flavours (*probability*)
- 4 (*0.14*)
- 5 (*0.35*)
- 6 (*0.31*)
- 7 (*0.20*)
What is the mean amount of flavours the ice cream shop sells? Give your answer in two decimals.
> *4*0.14 + 5*0.35 +6*0.31 + 7*0.20 = 0.56 + 1.75 + 1.86 + 1.4 = 5.57*
