## Final practices
1. We conduct an investigation into the link between willingness to act with narcissism and age. We measure willingness to act either through a self-reported continuous measure, or a binary behavioural measure (whether or not a person will sign a petition). Narcissism and age are both continuous measures. If we want to predict willingness to act through behaviour using narcissism scores and age, which of the following is the most suitable technique is?
- Linear regression
- **Logistic regression**
- Exponential regression

****2.****We want to compare self-reported willingness to act in sociology and political science students, and decide to use a non-parametric test. Which of the following is the most suitable test?

- **Wilcoxon**
- McNemar
- Kruskal-Wallis

1. If we want to determine whether the proportion of men and women are equal in three education groups (high school / vocational school / university), which of the following is the most suitable test?
- Rank test
- **Chi-square test**
- Kruskal-Wallis test

1. We want to test if political science students sign a petition (i.e. yes vs. no) more often than sociology students. Which of the following is the most suitable test?
- McNemar
- T-test for paired differences
- **Z-test for two independent proportions**

1. We compare self-reported willingness to act between sociology and political science students. It is an advantage if we can assume that the standard deviations of the population are the same, because the degrees of freedom value is:
- **Larger, and hence the test is more easily significant**
- Smaller, and hence the test is more easily significant
- Smaller, and hence the test is less easily significant

****6.****Suppose we do not find a significant difference in self-reported willingness to take action between two experimental conditions. The power of the test can be increased next time through

- Using a smaller α level
- **Using a larger sample**
- Using a larger sample and a smaller α

1. We looked at how willing people were to sign a petition when it was framed in a positive, negative or neutral tone. Experts believe that the positive and negative petitions were formulated in a far more extreme way than normal. If the petitions were formulated in a less extreme way in a follow-up study, which of the following would likely happen to the statistical power?
- **Decrease**
- Increase
- Remain the same

1. Suppose that we find a significant effect of positive and negative framing on willingness to take action, where the positive condition is linked to a significantly higher willingness to take action than the negative and neutral conditions. Later this study is repeated ten times in similar circumstances and each time no significant effect is found. Our finding was probably a:
- **Type I error**
- Type II error
- The correct decision

1. When a parametric test is used to see whether the three types of petition framing have a different effect on self-reported willingness to take action, then self-reported willingness to take action must be:
- Ordinal
- Categorical
- **Quantitative**

1. We compare self-reported willingness to act in students of sociology and political science with a t-test, and expect political science students to be more willing to act. Suppose that the two groups are small and divided very unevenly, both containing a number of extreme values. Which of the following tests is best if we conduct a t-test?
- **Two-sided**
- Left-sided
- Right-sided

1. We try to predict self-reported willingness to act using narcissism scores. The R2 is very low so we decide to add a predictor. We want to choose gender or age. Suppose gender is strongly linked with narcissism and moderately with willingness to act. Age correlates weakly with narcissism and moderately with willingness to act. Which of the following is most likely to be the best predictor?
- Gender
- **Age**
- Cannot be determined

1. When students in the three petition-framing conditions do not significantly differ in self-reported willingness to act, which of the following test statistic values do we expect?
- much greater than 1
- **approximately equal to 1**
- approximately equal to 0

- Sensitivity is low
- None of the predictors are significant
- **Sensitivity is low and none of the predictors are significant**

1. We investigate the effect of the framing condition, study subject (political science / sociology) and the interaction between framing condition and study subject on self-reported willingness to act. We do this using a two-way analysis of variance. Based on the table below, report the test statistic for establishing whether the effect of framing on willingness to act is different for sociology students versus political students.

1. A very large-scale Dutch study of more than ten thousand participants examined what proportion of people were willing to sign a neutrally-framed petition on the empowerment of citizens in local governance. This proportion was 0.217 and represents the population value due to the large sample size. We want to know whether the proportion of students in our investigation who signed the petition in the neutral condition (51 out of 160 students) significantly differed from the proportion in the national survey. Test this hypothesis and give the test statistic.

1. We approach our student sample again a year later and offer them the same petition to sign. We record whether or not they sign the petition. See the results below.
