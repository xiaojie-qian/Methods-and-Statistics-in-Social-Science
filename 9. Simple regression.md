1. The famous singer Yoncebé is selling tickets for her new tour. She wants to see the change in ticket sales, as a result of price, and expects that a lower price will lead to more ticket sales.
In this situation, ticket price is the i)…. variable and number of tickets sold is the ii)…. variable.
Which of the following statements is most appropriate?

- i) Predictor, ii) Response


- i) Response, ii) Predictor


- i) Predictor, ii) Predictor


- i) Response, ii) Response

2. Yoncebé is selling tickets for her new tour. She wants to see the change in ticket sales, as a result of price. 
Based on data from previous tours, Yoncebé has found the regression equation: number of tickets = 3000 - 7.3x, where x = ticket price.
If Yoncebé prices the tickets at $50, how many tickets is she predicted to sell?

3. You look at the relationship between how much time people spend on the website ‘Bookface’ and how productive they are at work. You assume that time spent on Bookface is the predictor variable, and time spent working is the response variable. The correlation between minutes spent on Bookface and minutes spent working is -0.5. The standard deviation in Bookface time is 4.86, and the standard deviation of time spent working is 3.50.
You want to find the values for the equation ŷ_i = a + bx_i

4. A farmer is having problems with birds eating her crops. She tries putting up different numbers of scarecrows to keep the birds away. The average number of crops eaten is 200, and the average number of scarecrows she has put up is 20. 
The farmer finds some of the linear regression equation: 
number of crops eaten = a - 0.8*(number of scarecrows). 
What is the value of the intercept?

6.Why do we model the population mean in regression?

- Because we only need to know the mean value of a variable in the population.


- Because there is too much error in the sample to explain the dependent variable value at the population level, and this error is different from the error in the population.


- Because we assume the dependent variable is normally distributed at each level of the independent variable in the population and the line goes through these means.

7. You noticed that the bus is a lot more crowded when the weather is bad, and decided to run a regression analysis of amount of rainfall, and the number of people on the bus. 
You found a positive relationship, and want to know how much of the variation in number of people on the bus can be explained by rainfall. Which of the following tells you this?

- regression coefficient

- Regression sum of squares

- Total sum of squares

- R-squared

8. You noticed that the bus is a lot more crowded when the weather is bad, and decided to run a regression analysis of amount of rainfall, and the number of people on the bus.

9.People seem to have less accidents when there are stop signs around. Your friend measures the number of stop signs in various neighbourhoods in various cities and finds a negative relationship when he plots the number of accidents against number of stop signs, combining the results per city. They tell you that if your street gets a stop sign, there will be fewer accidents.

Which of the following potential pitfalls apply to your friend’s statement?


There is an outlier.


The relationship is not linear.


Correlation is not causation.


Ecological fallacy.


Restriction of range.

10. You measured the amount of time 20 people wait at traffic lights on the way to work, and how angry they are when they arrive. As you expected, there was a positive relationship between time spent waiting at lights, and anger levels. You found a b-value of 7.2, with a standard error of 2.8.

Which of the following statements are correct? Select all that apply.


p < 0.05


p > 0.05


We reject the null hypothesis.


We accept the null hypothesis.

11. You examine the relationship between body fat and exercise patterns, in a sample of 100 people. Your slope value was -10.3, with a standard error of 6.06. The t-value for your df associated with a significance level of 95% is 1.99.

Calculate a confidence interval for your test statistic. 

Does the value 0 fall within your confidence interval?


No, 0 is outside of the confidence interval.


Yes, 0 is inside the confidence interval.

14.You read about some research into the relationship between height and shoe size. The 95% confidence interval for the predicted population mean is [10.65, 18.32]. 
What does this mean?


- We are 95% sure that mean shoe size in the population lies between 10.65 and 18.32.


- In 95% of repeated samples, the population mean shoe size will lie in the interval, so we find it plausible that mean shoe size lies between 10.65 and 18.32.


- 95% of population shoe size means are likely to lie between 10.65 and 18.32.


- 95% of the sample shoe sizes lie between 10.65 and 18.32.

17. A celebrity called Wayne East has been having some money problems recently. He is thinking of investing in the greatest record in the world, and wants to know how the value will change over time. He has an exponential regression model where his predictor is time in months, and response variable is money, measured in thousands of dollars. The alpha value is 4.2, and beta is 1.03. 
Based on this model, how much money (in thousands) will he have after six months?
