- ** We want to see if more women drink coffee than men.**
- **We want to see if gender and drink preference are independent.**
- **We want to see if tea is independent from coffee.**
- **We want to see if men are independent from women.**

3. If we are looking at whether there is an association between different neighbourhoods and types of crime, which of the following statements is/are correct? Select all that apply.

- [ ]  **Our null hypothesis is that neighborhood and type of crime are independent.**
- [ ]  **Our null hypothesis is that neighborhood and type of crime are dependent.**
- [ ]  **If neighborhood and crime are independent, we can calculate the observed joint frequencies by multiplying the marginal frequencies, divided by the sample size.**
- [ ]  **If neighborhood and crime are not independent, we can calculate the observed marginal frequencies by multiplying the joint frequencies, divided by the sample size.**
- [ ]  **If the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis are significantly different from the observed frequencies, then the categories are independent.**
- [ ]  **If the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis are significantly different from the observed frequencies, then the categories are dependent.**

7. A baker is interested in whether there is an association between three types of cookies, and gender of the buyer. He finds the following contingency table, and a significant Chi-square value of 10.584.
    
    
    |  | Men | Women |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Chocolate | 11 | 11 |

8. A researcher is interested in if there is an association between type of pet owned, and voting habits. The following table shows standardized residuals. What can he say about pet ownership and voting behavioral?
    
    
    |  | Democratic | Republican | Independent |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Cat | 1.85 | 1.58 | -2.84 |
    | Dog | 1.46 | 1.22 | -2.21 |
    | Other | -2.78 | -2.35 | 4.23 |
    - **Republican and democratic voters seem to have cats and dogs, while independent voters have other pets.**
    - **The chi-square value must be significant because some of the scores exceed, or are close, to 3 standard deviations from the mean.**
    - **Fewer cat and dog owners were counted, compared to people with other pets.**

9. A doctor’s surgery assumes that in one day about 10% of their patients will come in with emergencies, 40% with non-emergencies, and 50% with general questions.
    
    If 30 patients visit the doctor, what are the expected frequencies of emergencies, non-emergencies and general questions, respectively?
    
    - **3, 12, 15**
    - **10, 40, 15**
    - **6, 24, 30**
<br>

10. A doctor’s surgery assumes that about 10% of their patients will come in with emergencies, 40% with non-emergencies, and 50% with general questions.

11. A university cafeteria sells sandwiches, salads and snacks all day. The manager is looking at the association between types of visitors (students, academic staff, general university workers) to see if there is an association between food choice (sandwiches, salads and snacks) and visitor type, so that he can prepare in advance for influxes of certain visitors.
    
    Which of the following would be a problem for performing a Chi-square analysis? Select all that apply.
    
    - [ ]  **Visitors come to the cafeteria at random.**
    - [ ]  **Visitors purchase more than one food.**
    - [ ]  **Not all visitors buy anything.**
    - [ ]  **No students buy salad.**
<br>
12. The cafeteria is open all day. During the cafeteria manager's lunch break, he tracks the three types of people (students, academic staff, general university workers) and the three food orders (sandwiches, salads and snacks). 30 people come in, which leads to a chi-square value with an associated p-value of 0.04, using an alpha level of 0.05. Based on this, he decides to stock up on specific foods for influxes of specific people.
    
    Which of the following make the manager’s decision problematic? Select all that apply.
    
    - [ ]  **He had too few cases to reliably reject the null hypothesis.**
    - [ ]  **Failing to reject the null hypothesis does not indicate independence.**
    - [ ]  **The sampling was not random.**
    - [ ]  **He did not establish an expected distribution beforehand.**

13. You have quite a lot of plants in and outside your house, some of which have flowers, and some of which don't. Your flower data is presented below:
    
    
    |  | Indoors | Outdoors |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Flower | 7 | 3 |
    | No flower | 1 | 12 |
    
    You find the following probability distribution for the upper left cell:
    

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/d-NAUeB3EeWBDQ73-3lhaw_8a5de726d24e100c706090118dca6414_Rplot03.png?expiry=1666828800000&hmac=8qxvXJuHRjgS2d4AXjnzn6f6_CAsit2smOCM6XqeBo0](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/d-NAUeB3EeWBDQ73-3lhaw_8a5de726d24e100c706090118dca6414_Rplot03.png?expiry=1666828800000&hmac=8qxvXJuHRjgS2d4AXjnzn6f6_CAsit2smOCM6XqeBo0)

On the basis of this, what can you say about the null hypothesis that flowering is independent from the plant being indoors or outdoors?

- **You would not reject the null-hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05**
- **You would reject the null-hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05**
- **You can't say anything about this null-hypothesis on the basis of the value in the upper-left cell.**
- **The null-hypothesis is wrongly stated and should be rephrased as "there is a relation between flowers and living indoors"**

    |  | Lying | Not lying |
    | --- | --- | --- |

    | Incorrect | 7 | 3 |
    - [ ]  **The conditional frequency of correctly identifying a liar has no further permutations.**
    - [ ]  **The frequency of correctly identifying a liar is equal to the expected frequency of 6.**
    - [ ]  **Correct and incorrect responses are independent from lying and not lying.**
    - [ ]  **The distribution of expected frequencies is different from 0.**
