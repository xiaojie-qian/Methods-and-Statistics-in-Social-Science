## Final test
1. **You’re running a study on procrastination and course completion in a sample of university students. Course completion status was either graduated, dropped out before the end of the first year, or dropped out after the first year. You measured procrastination as a continuous variable, comprised of the sum of three questionnaire subscales. At the same time you measured months until course completion as a ratio variable, IQ as a continuous variable, and several other variables (e.g. achievement motivation, failure anxiety, etc) as interval variables. The students were from 5 faculties: Business and Economics, Law, Humanities, Social Sciences and Medicine.** 

   Some students did not complete the procrastination questionnaire, but all completed the continuous IQ measure. If the researcher was interested in if there was a      difference in IQ between those who did and did not complete the procrastination questionnaire, which test would the researcher use?

- T-test for paired differences
- **T-test for two independent groups**
- Test for the difference between two independent proportions

<br>

2. Which test would the researcher use to determine whether months until course completion was related to procrastination?
- Analysis of variance
- Chi-square test
- **Correlation/Bivariate regression**

<br>

3. If the researcher wanted to know whether student’s faculty was related to completion status, which test should they use?
- Analysis of variance
- **Chi-square test**
- Correlation/Bivariate regression

<br>

4. Suppose that the researcher wants to know if exam grades differ across student completion statuses (graduated, dropped out before first year, dropped out after first year). The researcher counts the exam grades as ordinal variables. Which test should they use?
- **Kruskal-Wallis**
- Analysis of variance
- Chi-square test

<br>

5. To predict study duration, the researcher performs a multiple regression test using procrastination and IQ scores as predictors. They also want to control for the student’s faculty ( Business and Economics, Law, Humanities, Social Sciences and Medicine). How many dummy variables will they need for the regression equation?
- **4**
- 5
- 6

<br>

6. If the researcher transform the IQ scores into the categories 'low' (84 and below), 'average' (85-115) and high (116 and higher), what is the measurement level of this transformed variable?
- Interval
- **Ordinal**
- Nominal

<br>

7. The researcher wants to know to whether they can predict whether or not students pass the first year based on procrastination, IQ and whether or not the student passed their first year exams. Which test should they use?
- **Logistic regression**
- Exponential regression
- Linear multiple regression

<br>

8. The researcher wants to know if the number of credits earned after one year, is the same in the different faculties. A one-way analysis of variance is performed, which yields an F-value that is greater than the critical limit value.

This means that

- All group means differ from each other.
- Group averages are all approximately equal to each other.
- **At least one group mean is significantly different from the other.**

<br>

9. The researcher wants to know if months until course completion can be predicted with the variable “tendency to procrastinate”. Which of the following intervals is widest with a bivariate linear regression of Y on X?
- The confidence interval for μy at a certain value of x.
- **The prediction interval at a particular value of x.**
- The above intervals are equally wide.

<br>

10. One wonders whether the pace of studying slows down after the first year. For the group that eventually graduates, the number of credits earned in the first year is compared with the number of credits earned in the second year. The table below shows the results.

|  | Mean | N | SD | SE Mean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Credits year 1 | 31.848 | 254 | 10.3808 | 0.6513 |
| Credits year 2 | 29.319 | 254 | 11.9676 | 0.7509 |

*SD* = 13.2278

Test if the average number of credits is lower in the second year. For this, take meanyear2 - meanyear1. The test statistic is

- **In the left critical zone, so H0 is rejected.**
- In the critical zone right, so H0 is rejected.
- Not in a critical area, so H0 is not rejected.

<br>

11. A number of students were not eligible for financial assistance during their course, and were dependent on a bank loan. The bank charged an interest rate of 8 percent per year and students were not able to change this. The final debt of these students plotted against the time factor can best be analyzed using a
- Linear Regression
- Logistic regression
- **Exponential regression**

<br>

12. The researcher wonders if procrastination - measured by the questionnaire - has predictive value in the study. Below are the averages and standard deviations for procrastination scores and course duration. The correlation between the two is 0.335 (n = 151, p = 0.000).

|  | Mean | SD | N |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Course duration | 70.84 | 20.094 | 151 |
| Procrastination | 2.6733 | 0.7534 | 151 |

What is the value of the regression coefficient if course duration is predicted on the basis of procrastination?

- 0.34
- **8.93**
- 0.01

<br>

13. In the group of students that graduated, the researcher looked at whether course duration different across faculties (Business and Economics, Medicine, Law, and other). They also looked at whether there an effect of gender, and an interaction effect. Below is the descriptive statistics, and part of the ANOVA table.

| Error | 92852.744 | 257 |

Which effect is significant?

- Main effect of gender.
- **Main effect of faculty.**
- Interaction between gender and faculty.

<br>

14. The researcher wants to know if passing or not passing the first year is related to the student’s gender. Proportions of male and female students that passed and did not pass the first year are shown in the table below.

|  | Passed | Not passed | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Female | 227 | 66 | 293 |
| Male | 92 | 51 | 143 |
| Total | 319 | 117 | 436 |

What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of male and female students that have passed the first year?

- (0.054, 0.209)
- **(0.039, 0.223)**
- (-0.164, 0.015)

<br>

15. To predict course duration a multiple regression test is conducted with the following predictors: procrastination, IQ, gender and scale scores for achievement motivation and failure anxiety. Results are shown in the table below.

|  | b | SE | t | p |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intercept | 49.588 | 10.245 | 4.84 | 0.000 |
| Procrastination | 7.419 | 2.562 | 2.896 | 0.004 |
| IQ | 2.62 | 3.093 | 0.847 | 0.398 |
| Gender | 7.324 | 3.652 | 2.006 | 0.047 |
| Achievement motivation | -0.19 | 0.272 | -0.7 | 0.485 |
| Failure Anxiety | 0.171 | 0.293 | 0.585 | 0.560 |

Which predictors significantly contribute to course duration?

- Procrastination
- **Procrastination, gender**
- Achievement motivation, failure anxiety.

<br>

16. Suppose the researcher tested whether the average scale score for procrastination was the same for students who did and did not graduate, and the test statistic was not significant. The null hypothesis was therefore not rejected. Later, it turned out that there was conclusively an effect after all (different population averages of both groups). What can we conclude?

The researcher initially

- Made a Type I error
- **Made a Type II error**
- Drew correct conclusions.

<br>

17. The number of students in the study from the Law faculty was relatively low. A few of the research questions with regards to this group did not yield significant results. However, the researchers were still not convinced that there were no differences in this population. n a follow-up study they want to increase the power.

They can do this through (select all that apply)

- [x]  **Taking a larger sample.**
- [x]  **Increasing the level of significance.**
- [ ]  **Examining groups that are less different from each other, so that the effect size becomes smaller.**

<br>

18. The researchers want to know if relatively more women graduate than men and created the table shown below.

|  | Women | Men | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not graduated | 111 | 76 | 187 |
| Graduated | 186 | 71 | 257 |
| Total | 297 | 147 | 444 |

What is the value of the test statistic? Use pwoman - pman in the calculation

- 6.80
- **2.88**
- 6.80

<br>

19. At the start of the study students completed a questionnaire measuring the personality traits of optimism and pessimism. The correlation between optimism and pessimism scores was -0.513, where p < 0.000.

What is the correct interpretation of the value 0.00 in this situation?

- The two-sided probability that the null hypothesis is true is equal to 0.000.
- The two-sided probability of finding a correlation coefficient with a value of -.513 is exactly equal to .000.
- **The correlation coefficient significantly differed from the value of 0 at a significance level of 0.05 with two-tailed test.**

<br>

20. See the test output below. What can we conclude about the regression model in which course duration is predicted by precrastination, failure anxiety, achievement motivation and gender?
21. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58776067/202562529-1288126a-75fd-4356-bb29-5c5e285ed784.png)

- The average of y is a significantly better predictor than the regression model.
- **The regression model is significantly better than the model that only uses the average of y.**
- The F value is significant, therefore, the regression model indicates that the predictors are poor predictors of y.

*R^2 = SSreg/SStot = 0.15486*

21. ***From this question onwards, please round all values used in calculations to 5 decimal places.***

The researcher was interested if the mean course duration is different for students from specific faculties, namely Business and Economics, Law and Social Sciences. To investigate this, they used a one-way ANOVA. The table below shows the descriptive statistics.

| Faculty | Mean | N | Std. Deviation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business and Economics | 81.11111 | 9 | 18.31969 |
| Law | 45.44444 | 9 | 14.99259 |
| Social Sciences | 63.88889 | 9 | 20.96094 |

<br>

26. The correlation between the procrastination questionnaire score and course duration is 0.375. What is the proportion of variance is explained by the variable ‘procrastination’ in a bivariate regression with course duration as the dependent variable?

*0.1406, r^2 = (0.275)^2*


<br>

27. The researcher wonders if study success is associated with faculty (here, just Law and Social Sciences). These are all nominal variables. On the basis of the table below the researcher tests is whether the variables are associated.

|  | Graduated | Dropped out before first year | Dropped out after first year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Law | 51 | 15 | 37 |

<br>

28. To test whether or not passing the first year depends on the student's procrastination score, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. The test also controlled for gender (female = 0, male = 1). See the results in the table below.

|  | B | S.E. | df | Sig. | Exp(B) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Procrastination | 0.397 | 0.192 | 1 | 0.039 | 1.487 |
| Gender | 0.672 | 0.301 | 1 | 0.026 | 1.959 |
| Intercept | -2.472 | 0.583 | 1 | 0.000 | 0.084 |

Mean procrastination was 2.7479, with a standard deviation of 0.77183. Based on the logistic regression model, what is the probability that a male student who has a procrastination score one standard deviation above the mean passes the first year?

*0.401*
