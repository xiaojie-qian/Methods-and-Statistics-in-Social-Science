Question 4
You’re interested in Wayne East’s new album. People seem to be very excited about it, but is it really that good? You ask your friends to rate it on a scale of 1 to 4, and expect that the median score will be higher than 2. Your friends ratings were 3.5, 4.2, 2.3, 3.0 and 1.0. 

You decide to check this with a Wilcoxon signed rank test. What is the test statistic?
